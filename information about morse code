 What Is Morse Code?
Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). It’s used to send messages, especially in telecommunication, by representing each letter and number with a unique combination of these signals.

 Historical Context: Why Morse Code Was Created
- Invented in the 1830s by American artist and inventor Samuel F.B. Morse, with help from Alfred Vail, Morse code was designed to solve the problem of slow long-distance communication.
- Before Morse code, messages were delivered by horseback, ship, or courier, often taking days or weeks.
- Morse’s telegraph system used electric pulses to transmit coded messages over wires, revolutionizing communication by enabling near-instant transmission across vast distances.
- The first official Morse code message, sent in 1844, was: “What hath God wrought?”

 How the Morse Code System Works
 Basic Principles
- Each letter, number, and punctuation mark is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes.
- For example:
- A = ·−
- B = −···
- S = ···
- O = −−− (used in the distress signal SOS: ···−−−···)
️ Timing and Structure
- A dot lasts for one unit of time.
- A dash lasts for three units.
- Spaces are crucial:
- Between parts of the same letter: 1 unit
- Between letters: 3 units
- Between words: 7 units
📡 Transmission Methods
- Morse code can be sent via:
- Sound (beeps or tones)
- Light (flashes)
- Radio signals
- Electrical pulses
